## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Ollama installed and available in `/usr/local/bin/ollama`
- At least one Ollama model downloaded

## Getting Started

1. Install Ollama following the instructions at [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull at least one model using Ollama CLI:
   ```bash
   ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
   ```
3. Clone this repository:

## Architecture

Kollama follows clean architecture principles and is organized into the following layers:

- **Presentation**: Compose UI components and ViewModels
- **Domain**: Business logic and model definitions
- **Data**: Repository implementations and local database
- **DI**: Dependency injection using Koin

### Key Components

- `ChatViewModel`: Manages chat state and user interactions
- `OllamaService`: Handles communication with Ollama models
- `ChatDatabase`: Local storage using Room
- `MarkdownFormatting`: Custom markdown processing and formatting

## Technical Features

### Database

- Room database for persistent storage
- Entities for chat sessions and messages
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity

### UI Components

- Custom composables for chat bubbles, model selection, and more
- Animated modifiers for enhanced visual feedback
- Markdown rendering with customizable typography

### State Management

- Kotlin Flow for reactive state updates
- ViewModel for UI state management
- Coroutines for asynchronous operations
